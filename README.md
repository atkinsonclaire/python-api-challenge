Weather Py: Three Trends
  1. The max temperature in Northern Hemisphere cities seem to have a higher correlation than those in the Southern Hemisphere.
  2. The graphs with the strongest correlations involved city latitudes and max temperatures (both as a whole, in the Northern Hemisphere and       in the Southern Hemisphere).
  3. All of the other relationships that I graphed had very low correlations. The linear regression line did not match the data in a clear and obvious way.
